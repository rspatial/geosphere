inconsistency reported by Ryan Case: bearing is expressed as -180 to 180 whereas bearingRhum is from 0 to 360

-- Current version
dist* functions threw an error when using a two row matrix  for p1, and missing p2. Fixed by setting "drop=FALSE". Bug report and fix by Miles Wood.

-- 2 November 2018, version 1.5.7
distHaversine bugged in some cases for antipodes: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45889616/why-does-disthaversine-return-nan-for-some-pairs-of-coordinates#
dist2gc always returned a positive value (the manual said it should be negative if it was at the left of the circle); in contrast with what the manual stated. Getting the sign is now an option. Reported by Charles Mohan, Hughan Ross and David Cooley
dist2gc used the bearing for an ellipsoid, not for a spheroid. Reported by Greg Whittier

-- 15 June 2016, version 1.5-5
Fixed error in gcMaxLat (reported by William Smith)
Bug fix in antipodal (reported by Gareth Davies)
Bug fix in gcIntermediate when crossing the date line

-- 7 July 2015, version 1.4-3
Included C-version of GeographicLib by C.F.F. Karney. areaPolygon and perimeter are now using that to compute these on a (WGS84) ellipsoid. New function distGeo (distance on an ellipsoid) also uses this.

-- 17 January 2014, version 1.3-8
Fixed bug in destPointRhumb. Reported by Bart Kranstauber
Fixed bug in bearingRhumb when using multiple points (incorrect results were returned). Reported by Bart Kranstauber
Added 'ID' output to dist2Line
distVincentyEllipsoid returned a distance of 0 between NA and NA; now it returns NA as intended (reported by Sebastian Luque)
Fixed minor bug in distMeeus (using 'isTRUE' where 'which' is appropriate) (reported by Tyler Smith)

-- 4 March 2012, version 1.2-27
Bug fix in antipodal; reported by Bart Kranstauber
Fixed bug in distMeeus. It returned NaN when the distance between two points was 0. Reportedby Daniel Reidpath
New function geomean to compute the mean of a set of coordinates (optionally with weights)

-- 28 August 2011, version 1.2-25
Correction to gcIntermediate. Points were not exactly equidistant. Error spotted by Jason Davies.

-- 18 May 2011, version 1.2-21
Normalizing longitude to -180..180 in midPoint. Suggested by Aaron Hardin

-- 13 Jan 2011, version 1.2-18
New argument sepNA in gcIntermediate, suggested by Lee Butterman

-- 1 Jan 2011, version 1.2-17
Merged functions distm and distm2 into distm
Function with new distance algorithm "distMeeus"

-- 4 Nov 2010
Additional options to gcIntermediate and greatCircle to return SpatialLines (that are cut in two when crossing the date line)

-- 8 Sept 2010
bug fix in .pointsToMatrix (reported by Joe)

-- 26 August 2010
New functions:
dist2Line computes the (spherical) distance between points and polylines (and polygons borders).
makeLine (like makePoly), adds intermediate great circle points to line segments, for better plotting
onGreatCircle tests if points are on a specified great circle

-- 25 August 2010
distVincentyEllipsoid now handles NA values. Bug fix suggested by George Wang.
