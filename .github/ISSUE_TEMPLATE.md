Here you can report bugs, or request a new feature. Please use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for "how-to" questions. 

When reporting a bug, please include a *minimal, self-contained, reproducible example* that illustrates the problem and test it with the development version of "terra", or at least with the current version on CRAN. "self-contained" means that, whenever possible, your example does not rely on a particular file or yours. Instead use example data created with code, or data that ships with R (see the terra help files for examples). 

Please also report your operating system and the output of `packageVersion("terra")` and of `terra::gdal(lib="all")`.

Except when discussing plots, do not include screen-shots. Instead, copy and paste the R code and responses from the R console.
